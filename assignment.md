## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each question:

Question 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
As the school is already running, using Scrum could help to improve the IT infrastructure incrementally with the system ongoing, this way we are able to adapt to new requirement and get live feedbacks whenever we implement a new feature, making sure we align with the school's needs. We will collabrate with the school to create a backlog, this allows transparency for the school and IT team to track the progress, we will piroritise what is the most crucial and work from there, so that the school can see the improvement sooner, leading to greater user satisfaction.

Question 2:

```

1. As someone who returns books late, I want to pay the overdue fine, so that my book borrowing limit can be lifted.

2. As someone who returns books late, I want to have a penalty system, so that I can kick my bad habits of always returning books late.

3. As a reader, I want to register an account on the website, so that I can start using the features.

4. As a reader, I want to login to the website, so that I can start using the features.

5. As a reader, I want to be able to search a book, so that I know the location and its availability.

6. As a reader, I want to extend my books return date, so that I can return books at a later date.

7. As a reader, I want to check how many books I can borrow, so that I will just take that amount of books with me.

8. As a reader, I want to check for the library events, so that I can attend those that interest me.

9. As a reader, I want to report the lost of book, so that the library will be awared and give me a penalty fine.
